# ShapeRender

Create an image from shape file(s).

Shape2Sqlite uses shapefile.py (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyshp/) or you can use the earth.db which already includes some shape files.
If you like to build your own database put all the wanted files (.shp and .dbf) in a directory called data.
</br>
ShapeRender uses the earth.db to make an image. You find three different configs at the end.

At the moment not every shape file works, so happy testing.
